This is a collection of algorithms I wrote to solve “Number Mind” puzzles, as introduced in Project Euler problem 185.

More details to come. The methods used are:

-Repeated hill-descent
-Simulated annealing
-Genetic algorithm
-Guess-wise crawl through possibilities
-Digit-wise crawl through possibilities
-Heap search
-Generalized constraint solver
-Mixed integer programming
-Repeated hill-descent using the Mimic algorithm to generate low-cost starting points

Additionally, Bayesian probability calculation was able to enhance the performance of many of the above algorithms.
